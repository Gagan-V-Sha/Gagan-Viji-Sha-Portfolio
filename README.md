# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gagan Viji Sha

### Master's Student | Data & Knowledge Engineer

I am a Master's student in Data and Knowledge Engineering at **Otto-von-Guericke University**, with a strong passion for transforming data into actionable insights.

As a former **Developer Intern at ATG India**, I gained hands-on experience by building and deploying a chatbot that **reduced user response time by 30%** and developing intuitive Flutter applications. My background as the **Co-Head of my university's research forum** has also equipped me with strong leadership, team management, and event organization skills.

I'm always looking for new challenges that combine my technical expertise with my drive to solve complex problems.
