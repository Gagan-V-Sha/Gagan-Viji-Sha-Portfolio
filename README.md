I am Gagan Viji Sha, a Master's student in Data and Knowledge Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. During my time as a Developer Intern at ATG India, I honed my skills in building practical solutions, including deploying a chatbot that enhanced user experience and developing intuitive Flutter applications. As the Co-Head of my university's research forum, I cultivated strong soft skills in team management and communication while organizing international conferences. My hands-on experience in signal acquisition for neuroscience and my current studies in Germany equip me with a unique combination of technical expertise and a global perspective.
